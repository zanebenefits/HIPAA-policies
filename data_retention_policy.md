# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Zane Benefits understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Zane Benefits is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Zane Benefits has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Zane Benefits Customers to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws

## Data Retention Policy

* Current Zane Benefits Customers have data stored by Zane Benefits as a part of the Zane Benefits Service.

	2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Zane Benefits.
	3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Zane Benefits within 30 days, Zane Benefits removed data from Zane Benefits systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.

# Vulnerability Scanning Policy

Zane Benefits is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. Zane Benefits utilizes [Nessus Scanner](http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) from Tenable to consistently scan, identify, and address vulnerabilities on our systems. We also utilize [OSSEC](http://www.ossec.net/) on all systems, including logs, for file integrity checking and intrusion detection.

## Vulnerability Scanning Policy

* Nessus management is performed by the Zane Benefits Security Officer with assistance from the Software Architect.
* Nessus is used to monitor all internal IP addresses (servers, VMs, etc) on Zane Benefits networks.
* Frequency of scanning is as follows:
	1. on a weekly basis;
	2. after every production deployment.
* Reviewing Nessus reports and findings, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, are the responsibility of the Zane Benefits Security Officer.
* In the case of new vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:
	* All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.
	* Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Security Officer, Software Architect, and Privacy Officer to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by Zane Benefits.
		* Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.
		* Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the Zane Benefits Risk Assessment Policy.
* All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by Zane Benefits.
* Penetration testing is performed regularly as part of the Zane Benefits vulnerability management policy.
	* External penetration testing is performed bi-annually by a third party.
	* Internal penetration testing is performed quarterly.
	* Gaps and vulnerabilities identified during penetration testing are reviewed, with plans for correction and/or mitigation, by the Zane Benefits Security Officer.
	* Penetration tests results are retained for 6 years by Zane Benefits.
* This vulnerability policy is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer.
